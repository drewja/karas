          <p>Dr. Bergman earned his bachelor’s degree in biochemistry at Iowa State University and his Doctorate of Dental Surgery
            degree from the University of Iowa College of Dentistry. During his time in school, he spent time working with

            emphasis on catching potential dental issues early on and correcting them with patient education before treatment
            is needed. In his own words, Dr. Bergman says,</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>"I find showing a patient what they could improve on to avoid a problem creates a relationship that is fulfilling
              for both myself and my patients."</p>
