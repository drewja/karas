        <h2> We Care About Your Smile </h2>
         <p>
        Welcome to Karas Dental, where you are the heart of our practice. We have three convenient locations in Elroy, Necedah, and
        Cottage-Grove, Wisconsin, and we would like to invite you to come and join our dental family. Dr. Christopher
        J. Karas has many years of experience restoring health and beauty to smiles. He uses some of the latest
        technology, including CEREC® same-day crown technology in our Elroy office and Sinsational Smile 20 minute
        whitening at all locations to help you achieve your dental goals. Whether you’re looking to brighten
        your smile, prevent cavities, or replace missing teeth, we can do it all. At Karas Dental, our goal is
        two-fold: we want to provide you with individualized care so that you receive the best treatment possible,
        and we strive to emphasize the importance of preventive dental care to your oral health. Each of our
        treatments is customized and personalized to fit your unique dental needs. As part of each six-month
        check-up, we will also take the time to help you understand how to prevent future dental problems such
        as cavities. You can count on us to help you achieve optimal oral health with conservative and personalized
        care.
