<h2>Preventive Dentistry</h2>

<p>Prevention is the key in dentistry. Many oral health problems can be avoided when good oral health habits are consistently practiced. Karas Dental and the ADA recommend dental cleanings and oral exams every six months and x-rays yearly. In addition we recommend sealants and fluoride when necessary. Diagnosing oral health problems at an early stage can prevent pain, tooth loss and and expensive dental bills.
When you consistently visit the dentist for your professional cleanings and exams and practice good oral hygiene at home, you can be assured that your smile will be healthy and radiant for a lifetime. Good home hygiene practices include brushing twice a day, flossing every day, eating healthy and balanced meals, and limiting your snack consumption between meals.
If you have any questions about preventive dentistry or how to maintain a healthy smile for life, please contact us today. We would love to help you achieve the smile of your dreams through preventive dentistry.</p>

<h2>Dental Cleanings</h2>

<p>Dental cleanings are an essential part of keeping your mouth and the rest of your body healthy. Many people see the mouth as separate from the rest of their body but the reality is that it’s all connected. Problems in your mouth can cause or even act as an indicator of disease in other parts of your body such as heart disease.
There are different types of teeth cleanings, depending on how healthy your gums are. At your initial appointment, our staff will evaluate your overall oral health and recommend appropriate cleaning.</p>

<h2>Periodontal (gum) Disease Treatment</h2>

<p>Periodontal (gum) disease is a serious disease caused by the accumulation of calculus and plaque. When allowed to advance, periodontal disease won’t only affect your teeth and gums, it can also affect your overall health. Recent research has linked periodontal disease to several serious health disorders, including:
  + High blood pressure
  + Diabetes
  + Pregnancy complications
  + Heart disease
  + Stroke</p>

<p>At Karas Dental in Elroy and Necedah, we provide deep cleanings (scaling and root planing) as well as preventive care to protect you from the dangers of periodontal disease. If you notice gums that bleed, are red, or are swollen, please contact us immediately as these are some of the first signs of periodontal disease. We look forward to providing you with a lifetime of healthy smiles!</p>

<h2>Oral Exams</h2>

<p>Many people mistakenly believe that the only time they need to see the dentist for an oral exam is when they are in pain or they think that something is wrong. Dentists not only evaluate a patients teeth and gums during an oral exam but they also look for lumps, swelling, discolorations, ulcerations and screen for oral cancer. In addition, the dentist will perform an examination of the head, neck and jaw, the tongue and salivary glands. In many cases dentists can spot early warning signs in the mouth that may indicate disease somewhere else in the body. 
Karas Dental recommends every patient have an oral exam every 6 months.</p>

<h2>Fluoride</h2>

<p>Fluoride makes tooth enamel more resistant to the acid that causes tooth decay. It can also help repair decay in its very early stages. Not only is fluoride important during childhood when teeth are still forming but it has proven benefits for adolescents and adults as well.
Our Registered Dental Hygienists will discuss whether your water is fluoridated and recommend any additional treatments if necessary.</p>

<h2>Sealants</h2>

<p>Sometimes when brushing it is difficult for your toothbrush to get in between the small cracks and grooves in our teeth. Over time decay can develop in these tiny areas. Sealants give your teeth extra protection against decay and help prevent cavities.
Dental sealants are a thin plastic coating that is applied to the chewing surface of the tooth. The sealant bonds to the surface and forms a protective layer over the enamel. With sealants, brushing your teeth becomes easier and more effective.
Who Should Get Sealants?
Children and teenagers are the best candidates for sealants. It is recommended that sealants be applied as soon as the permanent teeth have fully erupted as a preventive measure against tooth decay. Adults without decay or fillings in their molars can also benefit from sealants.
In some cases, dental sealants may also be appropriate for baby teeth, especially when they have deep depressions and grooves. Because baby teeth play such an important role in holding the correct spacing for permanent teeth, it's important to keep these teeth healthy so they are not lost too early.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Dentistry</h2>

<p>Protecting your child’s smile is a high priority for us at Karas Dental in Elroy and Necedah. Our dental team works hard to ensure that every time your child visits us, she or he feels comfortable and at home. We recommend that your child have their first dental appointment by the age of 3 or earlier if there is concern. Usually the first couple of appointments are just a ride in the chair to make the child comfortable.
Dr. Karas and our exceptional team will help them learn how to take care of his or her smile. Your child will learn the importance of:
  + Brushing all teeth twice a day
  + Flossing every day
  + Eating healthy meals
  + Limiting snacks between meals</p>

<p>We will teach your child with easy-to-understand terms and friendliness. To schedule a consultation at Karas Dental for your child, we invite you to contact us today. Together we can help your child achieve healthy smiles for a lifetime.</p>

<h2>White Resin restorations</h2>

<p>White (resin) fillings are an aesthetic option for restoring fractured, decayed, or cracked teeth. Dr. Karas closely matches the color of the white filling to the color of your tooth for the most natural-looking smiles possible. In one short visit at our office in Elroy or Necedah, Dr. Karas will:
  + Remove damaged tooth structure

  + Shape and polish the filling</p>

<p>White fillings are an aesthetically pleasing and conservative alternative to traditional silver fillings. If you would like more information on white fillings, please call Karas Dental today. We look forward to answering your questions!</p>

<h2>Root Canals</h2>

<p>Thanks to root canal therapy, Dr. Karas can save some teeth that are significantly decayed or damaged.

Dr. Karas can provide root canal therapy for teeth, including molars, which have:
  + Decay in the pulp
  + Significant injury or trauma
  + An abscess or infection</p>

<p>We can complete your root canal therapy in just one or two visits at Karas Dental in Necedah and Elroy.

To learn more about root canal therapy, or to schedule your appointment, please call or visit Karas Dental today.</p>

<h2>Bridges</h2>

<p>There are many treatments available for those who would like to replace their missing teeth. Bridges are non-removable appliances used to replace one missing tooth or several teeth in a row. Dr. Karas may recommend a custom dental bridge to:
  + Prevent facial sagging
  + Restore function to your mouth
  + Prevent other teeth from shifting
  + Replace an unwanted removable partial denture

<p>Over the course of a few visits to Karas Dental in Elroy or Necedah, your custom aesthetic bridge will be created and placed. Once complete, no one will ever know you were missing any teeth! For the most stable results, Dr. Karas may recommend attaching the bridge to a dental implant. To learn more about bridges and implant dentistry, give us a call soon!</p>

<h2>Complete Dentures and Partials</h2>

<p>Complete dentures and partials are removable appliances designed to replace your missing teeth. Complete dentures are for individuals with no natural teeth remaining while partials are for those who still have a few of their natural teeth. Dentures and partials can be used to:
  + Enhance the function of your mouth
  + Aesthetically replace your missing teeth
  + Restore your facial volume
  + Improve the beauty of your smile</p>

<p>Dentures require just a few visits to our office in Elroy or Necedah. When your denture is in place, you can enjoy eating, speaking, and living life normally once again.

<h2>Implant Restorations</h2>

<p>Dental implants are one of the most effective and secure options available for replacing missing teeth in modern dentistry. Dental implants replace both the root and crown of a missing tooth, while traditional tooth replacement options only replace the crown. Dr. Karas works closely with specialists in the area to complete your dental implant and replace your missing teeth. Dr. Karas will attach the dental implant restoration to the implant placed by the specialist. Depending on the number of missing teeth, your implant restoration could be a:
  + Crown
  + Bridge
  + Partial denture
  + Complete denture</p>

<p>Dental implants typically require several months and multiple appointments to complete, but they are an investment worth making. When complete, the function, health, and beauty of your smile will be restored and you can have the smile of your dreams. Call our office in Elroy or Necedah today if you are interested in learning more about implant dentistry. We will be happy to let you know if implants are right for you!</p>

<h2>Extractions</h2>

<p>Natural teeth are ideal for biting, chewing and maintaining mouth and jawbone structure, which is why at Karas Dental, our first priority is to help restore, save and repair your natural teeth. However, sometimes a tooth extraction is unavoidable.
The dentist at your local Karas Dental practicewill make sure you’re comfortable before, during, and after your extraction procedure. This includes walking you through every step of the tooth extraction, as well as the use of local anesthetics.
Mouth and Night Guards
Karas Dental can prescribe night guards for patients with temporomandibular joints (TMJ) pain, who grind their teeth or who snore. Your dentist will determine the best mouth guard for your situation.
Karas Dental can also fabricate athletic mouth guards for patients involved in sporting activities. These guards can be made in various colors and can even have their team names written on them.</p>

<h2>Nitrous Oxide</h2>

<p>Nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, is an effective and safe method of sedation dentistry. The effects of nitrous oxide wear off shortly after your treatment, which means that if you choose nitrous oxide to help you relax during your visit, you will be able to drive safely home. Nitrous oxide is a great option for individuals who have:
A need for extensive treatment
Fear or anxiety of visiting the dentist
Difficulty sitting still for a long time
With nitrous oxide, you can always have a relaxing and enjoyable visit. Nitrous oxide is also ideal for children who are a little nervous about visiting the dentist. For more information nitrous oxide or any of our services, please call or visit Karas Dental in Elroy or Necedah today.</p>
