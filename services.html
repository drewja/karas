<h2 id="preventive-dentistry">Preventive Dentistry</h2>

<p>Prevention is the key in dentistry. Many oral health problems can be avoided when good oral health habits are consistently practiced. Karas Dental and the ADA recommend dental cleanings and oral exams every six months and x-rays yearly. In addition we recommend sealants and fluoride when necessary. Diagnosing oral health problems at an early stage can prevent pain, tooth loss and and expensive dental bills. <br>
When you consistently visit the dentist for your professional cleanings and exams and practice good oral hygiene at home, you can be assured that your smile will be healthy and radiant for a lifetime. Good home hygiene practices include brushing twice a day, flossing every day, eating healthy and balanced meals, and limiting your snack consumption between meals. <br>
If you have any questions about preventive dentistry or how to maintain a healthy smile for life, please contact us today. We would love to help you achieve the smile of your dreams through preventive dentistry.</p>



<h2 id="dental-cleanings">Dental Cleanings</h2>

<p>Dental cleanings are an essential part of keeping your mouth and the rest of your body healthy. Many people see the mouth as separate from the rest of their body but the reality is that it’s all connected. Problems in your mouth can cause or even act as an indicator of disease in other parts of your body such as heart disease. <br>
There are different types of teeth cleanings, depending on how healthy your gums are. At your initial appointment, our staff will evaluate your overall oral health and recommend appropriate cleaning.</p>



<h2 id="periodontal-gum-disease-treatment">Periodontal (gum) Disease Treatment</h2>

<p>Periodontal (gum) disease is a serious disease caused by the accumulation of calculus and plaque. When allowed to advance, periodontal disease won’t only affect your teeth and gums, it can also affect your overall health. Recent research has linked periodontal disease to several serious health disorders, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
<li>Diabetes</li>
<li>Pregnancy complications</li>
<li>Heart disease</li>
<li>Stroke</li>
</ul>

<p>At Karas Dental in Elroy and Necedah, we provide deep cleanings (scaling and root planing) as well as preventive care to protect you from the dangers of periodontal disease. If you notice gums that bleed, are red, or are swollen, please contact us immediately as these are some of the first signs of periodontal disease. We look forward to providing you with a lifetime of healthy smiles!</p>

<h2 id="oral-exams">Oral Exams</h2>

<p>Many people mistakenly believe that the only time they need to see the dentist for an oral exam is when they are in pain or they think that something is wrong. Dentists not only evaluate a patients teeth and gums during an oral exam but they also look for lumps, swelling, discolorations, ulcerations and screen for oral cancer. In addition, the dentist will perform an examination of the head, neck and jaw, the tongue and salivary glands. In many cases dentists can spot early warning signs in the mouth that may indicate disease somewhere else in the body.  <br>
Karas Dental recommends every patient have an oral exam every 6 months.</p>



<h2 id="fluoride">Fluoride</h2>

<p>Fluoride makes tooth enamel more resistant to the acid that causes tooth decay. It can also help repair decay in its very early stages. Not only is fluoride important during childhood when teeth are still forming but it has proven benefits for adolescents and adults as well. <br>
Our Registered Dental Hygienists will discuss whether your water is fluoridated and recommend any additional treatments if necessary.</p>



<h2 id="sealants">Sealants</h2>

<p>Sometimes when brushing it is difficult for your toothbrush to get in between the small cracks and grooves in our teeth. Over time decay can develop in these tiny areas. Sealants give your teeth extra protection against decay and help prevent cavities. <br>
Dental sealants are a thin plastic coating that is applied to the chewing surface of the tooth. The sealant bonds to the surface and forms a protective layer over the enamel. With sealants, brushing your teeth becomes easier and more effective. <br>
Who Should Get Sealants? <br>
Children and teenagers are the best candidates for sealants. It is recommended that sealants be applied as soon as the permanent teeth have fully erupted as a preventive measure against tooth decay. Adults without decay or fillings in their molars can also benefit from sealants. <br>
In some cases, dental sealants may also be appropriate for baby teeth, especially when they have deep depressions and grooves. Because baby teeth play such an important role in holding the correct spacing for permanent teeth, it’s important to keep these teeth healthy so they are not lost too early.</p>



<h2 id="pediatric-dentistry">Pediatric Dentistry</h2>

<p>Protecting your child’s smile is a high priority for us at Karas Dental in Elroy and Necedah.

<h2 id="extractions">Extractions</h2>

<p>Natural teeth are ideal for biting, chewing and maintaining mouth and jawbone structure, which is why at Karas Dental, our first priority is to help restore, save and repair your natural teeth. However, sometimes a tooth extraction is unavoidable. <br>
The dentist at your local Karas Dental practicewill make sure you’re comfortable before, during, and after your extraction procedure. This includes walking you through every step of the tooth extraction, as well as the use of local anesthetics. <br>
Mouth and Night Guards <br>
Karas Dental can prescribe night guards for patients with temporomandibular joints (TMJ) pain, who grind their teeth or who snore. Your dentist will determine the best mouth guard for your situation. <br>

<h2 id="nitrous-oxide">Nitrous Oxide</h2>

<p>Nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, is an effective and safe method of sedation dentistry. The effects of nitrous oxide wear off shortly after your treatment, which means that if you choose nitrous oxide to help you relax during your visit, you will be able to drive safely home. Nitrous oxide is a great option for individuals who have: <br>
A need for extensive treatment <br>
Fear or anxiety of visiting the dentist <br>
Difficulty sitting still for a long time <br>
